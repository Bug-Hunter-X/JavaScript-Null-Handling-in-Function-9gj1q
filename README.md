This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to null value handling. The `foo` function doesn't explicitly check for `null` values, leading to silent termination instead of throwing an error or returning a meaningful default value.  The solution provides a robust approach by explicitly handling `null` values using either conditional logic or the nullish coalescing operator (??).
